# Graph Ramsey Number

This file defines the graph Ramsey number for simple graphs.

## Definitions

* `graphRamseyNum` - The n-ary graph Ramsey number `R(H₀, H₁, ..., Hₙ₋₁)`.
* `Ramsey` - The 2-ary specialization `R(G, H)`.

## Main Definition

The graph Ramsey number `R(H₀, H₁, ..., Hₙ₋₁)` is the smallest natural number `N` such that
any edge-coloring of the complete graph `K_N` with `n` colors contains a monochromatic
copy of `Hᵢ` in color `i` for some `i`.

Equivalently, for any partition of `K_N`'s edges into `n` subgraphs `c 0, c 1, ..., c (n-1)`,
there exists `i` such that `Hᵢ` is contained in `c i`.

## Notation

We provide an elaborator so that `R(G, H)` expands to `graphRamseyNum ![G, H]`.

namespace SimpleGraph

/--
An n-coloring of the edges of a graph `F` is a family of subgraphs `c : Fin n → SimpleGraph V`
such that they are pairwise edge-disjoint and their union equals `F`.

def IsEdgeColoring {V : Type*} (F : SimpleGraph V) (n : ℕ) (c : Fin n → SimpleGraph V) : Prop :=
  (∀ i, c i ≤ F) ∧
  (∀ i j, i ≠ j → Disjoint (c i) (c j)) ∧
  (⨆ i, c i) = F

/--
The graph Ramsey number `R(H₀, H₁, ..., Hₙ₋₁)` is the smallest natural number `N` such that
for any edge-coloring of `K_N` into `n` colors, there exists a color `i` with `Hᵢ` contained
in the `i`-th color class.

This is the non-induced graph Ramsey number.

noncomputable def graphRamseyNum {n : ℕ} {V : Fin n → Type*} [∀ i, Fintype (V i)]
    (H : (i : Fin n) → SimpleGraph (V i)) : ℕ :=
  sInf { N | ∀ (c : Fin n → SimpleGraph (Fin N)),
    IsEdgeColoring (⊤ : SimpleGraph (Fin N)) n c →
    ∃ i, (H i).IsContained (c i) }

/--
The 2-ary graph Ramsey number `R(G, H)` is the smallest natural number `N` such that
for any graph `R` on `N` vertices, either `G` is contained in `R` or `H` is contained in `Rᶜ`.

This is a direct definition equivalent to the 2-ary case of `graphRamseyNum`.
