/-- The unit `n`-sphere, defined as `Metric.sphere 0 1` in `EuclideanSpace ‚Ñù (Fin (n + 1))`. -/
abbrev unitSphere (n : ‚Ñï) : Set (EuclideanSpace ‚Ñù (Fin (n + 1))) := Metric.sphere 0 1

Does the 6-sphere admit a complex structure, i.e. an atlas of holomorphically compatible charts
relating it to `EuclideanSpace ‚ÑÇ (Fin 3)`?
