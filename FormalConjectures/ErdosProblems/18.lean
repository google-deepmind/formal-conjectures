# Erdős Problem 18

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/18](https://www.erdosproblems.com/18)

We call $m$ *practical* if every integer $1 \leq n < m$ is the sum of distinct divisors
of $m$. If $m$ is practical, let $h(m)$ be the least $k$ such that every $1 \leq n < m$
is the sum of at most $k$ distinct divisors of $m$.

Three questions:
1. Are there infinitely many practical $m$ such that $h(m) < (\log \log m)^{O(1)}$?
2. Is it true that $h(n!) < n^{o(1)}$?
3. Or perhaps even $h(n!) < (\log n)^{O(1)}$?

Known: Erdős showed $h(n!) < n$. Vose [Vo85] proved infinitely many practical $m$ with
$h(m) \ll (\log m)^{1/2}$. Erdős offered \$250 for a proof or disproof of whether
$h(n!) < (\log n)^{O(1)}$ [Er81h, p.172].

Conjecture (1): There are infinitely many practical $m$ such that
