Divergences from the hosted theorems (details in statements/648/draft.json):
- the sequence range follows the problem text, `2 ≤ a_1 < ⋯ < a_t < n` (`Set.Ico 2 n`);
  both hosted theorems allow `0 < m ≤ n` (`Set.Ioc 0 n`), which admits `1` and `n`.
- `P` is the FC-house `Nat.maxPrimeFac`; the hosted files define
  `P n = (n.primeFactors.max).getD 1`. The two agree on `2 ≤ m`.
- the sequence is a strictly monotone `a : Fin t → ℕ` (FC house shape); the hosted
  theorems use a `List ℕ` with `IsChain`.

`g n` is the largest `t` such that there exist integers `2 ≤ a 0 < a 1 < ⋯ < a (t - 1) < n`
whose greatest prime factors are strictly decreasing. -/

Let $g(n)$ denote the largest $t$ such that there exist integers $2\leq a_1<a_2<\cdots <a_t <n$
such that \[P(a_1)>P(a_2)>\cdots >P(a_t)\] where $P(m)$ is the greatest prime factor of $m$.
Estimate $g(n)$.

Stijn Cambie has proved [Ca25b] \[g(n) \asymp \left(\frac{n}{\log n}\right)^{1/2}.\]
Cambie further asks whether there exists a constant $c$ such that
\[g(n) \sim c \left(\frac{n}{\log n}\right)^{1/2}.\]
Cambie's proof shows that such a $c$ must satisfy $2\leq c\leq 2\sqrt{2}$.

The sequence $a_1<a_2<\cdots<a_t$ is packaged as a strictly monotone map `a : Fin t → ℕ`
with $2\leq a_i<n$, the greatest prime factor $P$ is `Nat.maxPrimeFac`, and $g(n)$ is the
supremum in `ℕ` of the achievable lengths $t$.
