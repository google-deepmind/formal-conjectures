There are infinitely many $n$ such that $d_n < d_{n+1} < d_{n+2}$, where $d$
denotes the prime gap function.

theorem erdos_6 :
    {n | primeGap n < primeGap (n + 1) ∧ primeGap (n + 1) < primeGap (n + 2)}.Infinite := by
  sorry

/--
For all $m$, there are infinitely many $n$ such that $d_n < d_{n+1} < \dots < d_{n+m}$,
where $d$ denotes the prime gap function.

Proved by Banks, Freiberg, and Turnage-Butterbaugh [BFT15] with an application of the
Maynard-Tao machinery concerning bounded gaps between primes [Ma15]
