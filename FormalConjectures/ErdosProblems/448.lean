/-- `tauPlus n` (written `τ⁺(n)`) counts the number of `k` such that `n` has a divisor in
`[2^k, 2^{k+1})`. Equivalently, the number of distinct values `⌊log₂ d⌋` as `d` ranges over the
divisors of `n`: a divisor `d` lies in `[2^k, 2^{k+1})` iff `Nat.log 2 d = k`. -/

/-- Always `τ⁺(n) ≤ τ(n)`: the occupied dyadic blocks are the image of the divisor set under
`Nat.log 2`, and an image has at most as many elements as its source. This is what makes the
`ε < 1` comparison in the problem meaningful. -/

/--
Let `τ(n)` count the divisors of `n` and `τ⁺(n)` count the number of `k` such that `n` has a
divisor in `[2^k, 2^{k+1})`. Is it true that, for all `ε > 0`,
$$ τ⁺(n) < ε · τ(n) $$
for almost all `n`?

The answer is **no**. This was disproved by Erdős and Tenenbaum [ErTe81], who showed that the
upper density of the set of such `n` is `≍ ε^{1-o(1)}` (the exponent `o(1) → 0` as `ε → 0`); in
particular this set does not have density `1` for small `ε`. A sharper bound `≪ ε log(2/ε)` and the
existence of a distribution function for `τ⁺(n)/τ(n)` were later established by Hall and
Tenenbaum [HaTe88, §4.6].
