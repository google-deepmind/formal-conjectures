open Filter Set Real Nat Topology

/--
The set of subset sums of a set `A ⊆ ℕ`.

def subsetSums (A : Set ℕ) : Set ℕ := {n | ∃ B : Finset ℕ, B ⊆ A ∧ n = ∑ i ∈ B, i}

/--
Is there a sequence $A=\{a_1\leq a_2\leq \cdots\}$ of integers with
\[\lim \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}=2\]
such that
\[P(A')= \left\{\sum_{n\in B}n : B\subseteq A'\textrm{ finite }\right\}\]
has density $1$ for every cofinite subsequence $A'$ of $A$?
