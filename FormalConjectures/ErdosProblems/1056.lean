/--
The proposition that the modular product of a collection of consecutive interval equals $1$ modulo $p$,
where intervals are defined by a function specifying the consecutive boundaries.

def allModProdEqualsOne (p : ℕ) {k : ℕ} (boundaries : Fin (k + 1) → ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ i : Fin k,
    (∏ n ∈ Finset.Ico (boundaries i) (boundaries (i + 1)), n) ≡ 1 [MOD p]

/--
Let $k ≥ 2$. Does there exist a prime $p$ and consecutive intervals $I_0,\dots,I_k$
such that $\prod\limits_{n{\in}I_i}n \equiv 1 \mod n$ for all $1 \le i \le k$?

This is problem A15 in Guy's collection [Gu04], where he reports that in a letter in 1979
Erdős observed that $3 * 4 \equiv 5 * 6 * 7 \equiv 1 \mod 11$.

Makowski [Ma83] found, for $k=3$:
$2 * 3 * 4 * 5 \equiv 6 * 7 * 8 * 9 * 10 * 11 \equiv 12 * 13 * 14 * 15 \equiv 1 \mod 17$.

Noll and Simmons asked, more generally, whether there are solutions to
$q_1! \equiv \dots \equiv q_k! \mod p$ for arbitrarily large $k$ (with $q_1 < \dots <q_k$).
