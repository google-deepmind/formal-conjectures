/--
Let $h(n)$ count the number of powerful integers in $[n^2, (n + 1)^2)$.

/--
Is there some constant $c > 0$ such that $h(n) < (\log n)^{c + o(1)}$ and, for infinitely many $n$,
$h(n) > (\log n)^{c - o(1)}$.

It is not hard to prove that $\limsup h(n) = \infty$.

It is not hard to prove that the density $δ_l$ of integers for which $h(n) = l$ exists
