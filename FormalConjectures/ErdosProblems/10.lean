# Erdős Problem 10

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/10](https://www.erdosproblems.com/10)

/--
The lower asymptotic density of a set $S$ is the $\liminf$ as $n → ∞$ of the
ratio $\frac{|\{a ∈ S \mid  a < n\}|}{n}$.
-/
noncomputable def lowerDensity (S : Set ℕ) : ℝ :=
    Filter.atTop.liminf (fun n => (Set.Iio n ∩ S).ncard / n)

/--
The set of natural numbers that can be written as a sum
of a prime and at most $k$ powers of $2$.

abbrev sumPrimeAndTwoPows (k : ℕ) : Set ℕ :=
  { p + (pows.map (2 ^ ·)).sum | (p : ℕ) (pows : Multiset ℕ) (_ : p.Prime)
    (_ : pows.card ≤ k)}

/--
Is there some $k$ such that every integer is the sum of a prime and at most $k$
powers of $2$?

Gallagher [Ga75] has shown that for any $ϵ > 0$ there exists $k(ϵ)$
such that the set of integers which are the sum of a prime and at most $k(ϵ)$
many powers of $2$ has lower density at least $1 - ϵ$.

Granville and Soundararajan [GrSo98] have conjectured that at most $3$
powers of $2$ suffice for all odd integers, and hence at most $4$ powers of $2$
suffice for all even integers.

and at most $3$ powers of $2$.

/--
Bogdan Grechuk has observed that $1117175146$ is not the sum of a prime and at most $3$
powers of $2$, and pointed out that parity considerations, coupled with the fact that there
are many integers not the sum of a prime and $2$ powers of $2$ suggest that there exist
infinitely many even integers which are not the sum of a prime and at most $3$ powers of $2$).
