/--
Given a finite set of points, this function counts the number of **unordered pairs** of distinct
points that are at a distance of exactly 1 from each other.
-/
noncomputable def unitDistancePairsCount (points : Finset ℝ²) : ℕ :=
  (points.offDiag.filter (fun p => dist p.1 p.2 = 1)).card / 2


/--
The set of all possible numbers of unit distances for a configuration of $n$ points.
-/
noncomputable def unitDistanceCounts (n : ℕ) : Set ℕ :=
  {unitDistancePairsCount points | (points : Finset ℝ²) (_ : points.card = n)}

/--
This lemma confirms that the set of possible unit distance counts is bounded above, which
ensures that taking the supremum (`sSup`) is a well-defined operation. The trivial upper bound is
the total number of pairs of points, $\binom{n}{2}$.

/--
The **maximum number of unit distances** determined by any set of $n$ points in the plane.
This function is often denoted as $u(n)$ in combinatorics.

  sSup (unitDistanceCounts n)


/--
Does every set of $n$ distinct points in $\mathbb{R}^2$ contain at most
$n^{1+O(\frac{1}{\log\log n})}$ many pairs which are distance $1$ apart?
