# Erdős Problem 480

Let $x_1,x_2,...∈[0, 1]$ be an infinite sequence. Is it true that there are infinitely many $m, n$
such that $|x_{m+n} - x_n| ≤ \frac 1 {\sqrt 5 n}$?

This was proved Chung and Graham.

For any $ϵ>0$ there must exist some $n$ such that there are infinitely many $m$
for which $|x_{m+n} - x_m| < \frac 1 {(c−ϵ)n}$, where
$c= 1 + \sum_{k≥1} \frac 1 {F_{2k}} =2.535370508...$
and $F_m$ is the $m$th Fibonacci number. This constant is best possible.
