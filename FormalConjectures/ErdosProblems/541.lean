We call a graph $D$-balanced (or $D$-almost-regular) if the maximum degree is at most $D$ times the
minimum degree.
Let $ϵ,α>0$ and $D$ and $n$ be sufficiently large. If $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with at least
$n^{1+α}$ edges, then must $G$ contain a $D$-balanced subgraph on $m>n^{1−α}$ vertices with at least
$ϵm^{1+α}$ edges?
