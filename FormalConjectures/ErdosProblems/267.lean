Let $F_1=F_2=1$ and $F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n−1}$ be the Fibonacci sequence.
Let $n_1 < n_2 < ...$ be an infinite sequence with $\frac{n_{k+1}}{n_k} ≥ c > 1$. Must
$\sum_k \frac 1 {F_{n_k}}$ be irrational?

Good [Go74] and Bicknell and Hoggatt [BiHo76] have shown that $\sum_n \frac 1 {F_{2^n}}$ is irrational.
