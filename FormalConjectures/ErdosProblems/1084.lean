# Erdős Problem 1084

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/1084](https://www.erdosproblems.com/1084)

Let `f_2(n)` be the maximum number of pairs of points at distance exactly `1`
among any set of `n` points in `ℝ²`, under the condition that all pairwise
distances are at least `1`.

Estimate the growth of `f_2(n)`.

Status: open.

/-- Erdős conjectured that the triangular lattice is best possible in 2D, in particular that
$f_2(3n^2 + 3n + 1) < 9n^2 + 3n$.

Note: in [Er75f] is read $9n^2 + 6n$, but this seems to be a typo.
