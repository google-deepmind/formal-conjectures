Given a polynomial `p`, the predicate that if the leading coefficient is positive and
there exists no $d≥2$ with $d ∣ p(n)$ for all $n≥1$, then for all sufficiently large $m$,
there exist integers $1≤n_1<\dots < n_k$ such that $$1=\frac{1}{n_1}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n_k}$$
and $$m=p(n_1)+\cdots+p(n_k)$$?

Let $p\colon \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ be a polynomial whose leading coefficient is
positive and such that there exists no $d≥2$ with $d ∣ p(n)$ for all $n≥1$. Is it true that,
for all sufficiently large $m$, there exist integers $1≤n_1<\dots < n_k$ such that
$$1=\frac{1}{n_1}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n_k}$$
and
$$m=p(n_1)+\cdots+p(n_k)$$?

GPT 5.5 Pro (prompted by Price) has given a proof that the answer is yes, for the stronger version
with $1$ replaced by any rational $\alpha>0$.

This was formalized in Lean by Ammanamanchi using Opus 4.6 and GPT 5.5 Pro.

Graham also conjectures that this remains true with $1$ replaced by an arbitrary rational $\alpha>0$
(provided $m$ is taken sufficiently large depending on $\alpha$).

Cassels [Ca60] has proved that these conditions on the polynomial imply every sufficiently large
integer is the sum of $p(n_i)$ with distinct $n_i$.

van Doorn [vD25] has investigated the question of what 'sufficiently large' means for $p(x)=x$.
van Doorn has also proved the original conjecture for many linear and quadratic polynomials.
For example, if $p(x) = x + b$ with $1 \leq b \leq 5000$, then the conjecture is true.

van Doorn [vD25] has proved the original conjecture for many linear and quadratic polynomials.
For example, if $p(x) = x^2 + b$ with $1 \leq b \leq 800$, then the conjecture is true.
