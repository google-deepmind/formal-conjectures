additively complete because every term but the first $\lfloor 3/2\rfloor = 1$ is a multiple of
$3$ (namely $\lfloor (3/2)\cdot 2^{n+1}\rfloor = 3\cdot 2^n$), so every subset sum is
$\equiv 0$ or $1 \pmod 3$; the infinitely many integers $\equiv 2 \pmod 3$ are never reached.

the sequence $\lfloor t\alpha^n\rfloor$ is NOT entirely additively complete: the very first gap
$\lfloor t\rfloor < \lfloor t\rfloor+1 < \lfloor t\alpha\rfloor$ already misses the positive
integer $\lfloor t\rfloor+1$.

This is the $r = 0$, $m = \lfloor t\rfloor + 1$ instance of `entire_gap_not_complete`. The gap
inequality comes from $t\alpha \ge t\cdot(5/3) = t + 2t/3 \ge t + 2 \ge \lfloor t\rfloor + 2$.
The constant $5/3$ (not $\varphi$) is the sharp clean threshold uniform in $t \ge 3$: at
$\alpha = \varphi$, $t = 3$ gives $\lfloor 3\varphi\rfloor = 4 = \lfloor t\rfloor+1$, so the first
gap closes. This is *entire* (not eventual) incompleteness; the gap need not recur for
$\varphi \le \alpha < 2$, where Erdős Problem 349 stays open. -/

/-- **Erdős Problem 349, sharp entire completeness for $1 \le t < 2$ on the strip
$1 < \alpha < 3/2$.**

The sequence $\lfloor t\alpha^n\rfloor$ is *entirely* additively complete: every positive
integer $k \ge 1$ is a finite subset sum of distinct terms.

A **partial result** on the open Erdős Problem 349 and on the named open conjecture
`complete_for_alpha_in_Ioo_one_to_goldenRatio` (restricted to $\alpha < 3/2$, entire sense, and
$t < 2$). Sharpens `isGoodPair_one_alpha_of_lt_three_halves` (its $t = 1$ special case) by taking
$t < 2$ as a direct hypothesis instead of deriving it from $t\alpha < 2$: the doubling bound
`floor_mul_pow_succ_le_two_mul` already holds for every $1 \le t$ on this strip, so the widening
is free. E.g. $(t, \alpha) = (1.7, 1.4)$ has $t\alpha = 2.38 > 2$ yet is covered here.

Proof: instantiate `entirely_complete_of_doubling` with $a_n = \lfloor t\alpha^n\rfloor$, using
`floorSeq_zero_eq_one_of_lt_two` for $a_0 = 1$ and `floor_mul_pow_succ_le_two_mul` for the

/-- **Erdős Problem 349, not entirely complete for $2 \le t$.**

For $2 \le t$ and $1 \le \alpha$, every term $\lfloor t\alpha^n\rfloor \ge \lfloor t\rfloor \ge 2$,
so every subset sum of the range is $0$ (empty subset) or $\ge 2$ (nonempty subset of values each
$\ge 2$): the value $1$ is never a subset sum, so the range is not entirely additively complete.

This is the DeepMind-faithful "only if" direction of the sharp threshold ($t \ge 2$), and it
matters to state precisely: the superficially plausible stronger claim "$t\alpha \ge 2 \Rightarrow$
not entirely complete" is FALSE under this repository's $n = 0$ indexing — e.g.
$(t, \alpha) = (3/2, 7/5)$ has $t\alpha = 2.1 \ge 2$ yet IS entirely complete, because
$a_0 = \lfloor t\rfloor = 1$ already saves it. The correct sharp threshold is on $t$ alone, not on
$t\alpha$; that is exactly `entirelyComplete_floorSeq_iff_lt_two` below.

/-- **Universal Brown condition for $0 < t < 2$ on the strip $1 < \alpha < 3/2$.** The floor
sequence $a_n = \lfloor t\alpha^n\rfloor$ satisfies $a_n \le 1 + C(n)$ for **every** $n$ (not
merely eventually), where $C(n)$ sums the distinct values among $a_0, \ldots, a_{n-1}$. This is
the `hbrown` hypothesis of `eventuallyComplete_of_brown_of_base_window` instantiated with the
witnesses $N_0 = 0$, $L = 0$: since $C\ a\ 0 = 0$, no "eventually" is available and the bound must
hold from $n = 0$ on.

Proof sketch (two phases, split at the first index $n_0$ where the sequence jumps by at least
$2$): while all increments are $\le 1$ (Phase 1), $t < 2$ gives $a_0 \le 1$ so the values form an
initial segment and $2C(n+1) \ge a_n(a_n + 1)$ grows quadratically, giving the Brown condition
directly. If a jump $a_{n_0 + 1} \ge a_{n_0} + 2$ occurs (Phase 2), it forces
$t\alpha^{n_0}(\alpha - 1) > 1$, hence $t\alpha^{n_0} > 2$ (as $\alpha - 1 < 1/2$ from
$\alpha < 3/2$), hence $a_{n_0} \ge 2$; the Phase 1 quadratic stock then starts the linear
invariant $a_n + 1 \le 2C(n)$, which is self-propagating (all terms distinct past $n_0$, so
$C(n+1) = a_n + C(n)$) and carries the Brown condition forward:
$2a_{n+1} \le 3a_n + 2 < 2(1 + C(n+1))$.

/-- **Erdős Problem 349, eventual completeness for $0 < t < 2$ on the strip $1 < \alpha < 3/2$.**

The pair $(t, \alpha)$ is good, i.e. $\lfloor t\alpha^n\rfloor$ is additively complete in the
**eventual** sense. Instantiates `eventuallyComplete_of_brown_of_base_window` with the explicit
base window $N_0 = 0$, $L = 0$: `hbase` is trivial ($C\ a\ 0 = 0$, so the only admissible $k$ is
$0 = \sum_{i \in \emptyset} i$) and `hbrown` is `floorSeq_brown_all`.

This closes the sub-case $0 < t < 1$ left out of scope by `isGoodPair_of_one_le_lt_two` /
`entirelyComplete_floorSeq_iff_lt_two` above (which need $1 \le t$): for $0 < t < 1$,
$a_0 = \lfloor t\rfloor = 0$ and the sequence begins with a prefix of zeros, so *entire*
completeness is not even the right notion there — only *eventual* completeness, which is exactly
`IsGoodPair`. Together with `isGoodPair_of_one_le_lt_two` this gives eventual completeness for
**all** $0 < t < 2$ on the strip, strictly beyond the *entire*-completeness threshold $t < 2$
proved there: e.g. $(t, \alpha) = (7/4, 7/5)$ has $t\alpha = 2.45 > 2$, outside van Doorn's
"easy" $t\alpha < 2$ range, yet is covered here.

/- ## Good pairs deep in the open zone `1 < α < 3/2` for `t ≥ 2`

The results below extend the partial characterization of Erdős Problem 349 with 21 concrete good
pairs $(t, \alpha)$ satisfying $t \ge 2$, reaching well beyond the strip $\alpha \le 1 +
1/(2\lfloor t\rfloor + 2)$ already covered by `isGoodPair_of_pos_of_lt_two` above (which only
handles $t < 2$).

The engine is a **reduction theorem**, `isGoodPair_of_run`: the whole (still open) band $t \ge
2$, $1 < \alpha < 3/2$ collapses to a single finite combinatorial certificate — a rank $N_0$ at
which the floor sequence produces a *new* value whose predecessors' subset sums already cover a
run of length $\ge a_{N_0}$. It is proved by adding a *deficit* parameter to the base-window
engine `eventuallyComplete_of_brown_of_base_window` above (letting the covered window sit
strictly inside $[L, C\ a\ N_0]$ instead of filling it exactly), then instantiated below with 21
explicit finite certificates, each kernel-checked by `decide` on concrete `Finset ℤ` literals.

**Why this does not close the band.** The reduction does not narrow the band itself: at its
$\alpha \to 3/2^-$ endpoint, the arithmetic core of the (RUN) certificate — the existence of a
$t$ making every $\lfloor t\alpha^n\rfloor$ share a nontrivial common structure forever — is
literally Mahler's $3/2$ problem (non-existence of "$Z$-numbers"), open since 1968. What *is*
proved here is that the band can be filled **arbitrarily close to $3/2$, point by point**: the
barrier obstructs only the universal statement over the whole band, not any single concrete
pair. -/

/-- **Subset-sum witness constructor.** If $B \subseteq A$ (as finite sets of integers) and

/-- **Eventual-completeness engine with an interior deficit window.** Generalizes
`eventuallyComplete_of_brown_of_base_window` above by letting the covered base window sit
*strictly inside* $[L, C\ a\ N_0]$, at distance $D$ from its right end. Let $a : \mathbb{N} \to
\mathbb{Z}$ be nonnegative, monotone and unbounded, and suppose there are $N_0 : \mathbb{N}$ and
$L, D \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that: (i) *interior base window* — every $k$ with $L \le k \le C\ a\
N_0 - D$ is already a subset sum of $\{a_0, \ldots, a_{N_0-1}\}$; (ii) *shifted Brown margin* —
$a_n + L + D \le 1 + C\ a\ n$ for every $n \ge N_0$. Then $\operatorname{range} a$ is additively
complete in the eventual sense.

Taking $D = 0$ recovers `eventuallyComplete_of_brown_of_base_window` exactly. The deficit $D$ is
what lets `isGoodPair_of_run` below reduce goodness to a *finite* certificate: taking
$D := C\ a\ N_0 - U$ for an explicit run $[L, U]$ collapses (i) to the run hypothesis and the base
case of (ii) to a single arithmetic inequality on $a_{N_0}$.

Textbook-level: a purely combinatorial merge-induction on monotone integer sequences (no $t,
\alpha$), directly analogous to `eventuallyComplete_of_brown_of_base_window`; the research content

window collapses to exactly the run hypothesis, and the base case of the shifted Brown margin
(`floorSeq_brown_shifted`) collapses to exactly $a_{N_0} \le U - L + 1$.

A **partial result** on the open Erdős Problem 349, in the same family as
`isGoodPair_of_pos_of_lt_two` above but for the $t \ge 2$ regime that theorem does not cover.

The proof is recorded via the `formal_proof` mechanism rather than written inline, as it exceeds
the repository's proof-length guideline. -/

`isGoodPair_of_run` exactly like the four headline results above (explicit floor values up to a
new rank $N_0$, matched against a finite window certificate); bundled into one statement so the
family is reviewed as a single declaration rather than seventeen near-identical ones. In the order
listed: $t = 5/2$ at $\alpha = 4/3$; $t = 2$ at $\alpha \in \{4/3, 5/4, 112/75, 299/200,
1499/1000\}$; $t = 5/2$ at $\alpha \in \{29/20, 449/300\}$; $t = 3$ at $\alpha \in \{4/3, 5/4,
37/25, 89/60, 1499/1000\}$; $t = 4$ at $\alpha = 76/53$; $t = 5$ at $\alpha = 79/55$; $t = 7$ at
$\alpha = 71/51$; $t = 10$ at $\alpha = 43/34$. Together with the four headline pairs, this gives
**21 good pairs total** with $t \in \{2, 5/2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10\}$ and $\alpha$ ranging from $5/4$ up
to $14999/10000$, all strictly outside the strip $\alpha \le 1 + 1/(2\lfloor t\rfloor+2)$ covered
