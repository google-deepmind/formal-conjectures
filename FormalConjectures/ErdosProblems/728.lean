Let $\varepsilon, C, C' > 0$. Are there integers $a, b, n$ such that
$$\varepsilon n < a < (1 - \varepsilon) n,\quad \varepsilon n < b < (1 - \varepsilon) n,
  \quad a!\, b! \mid n!\, (a + b - n)!, $$
and
$$C \log n < a + b - n < C' \log n ?$$

theorem erdos_728 : answer(sorry) ↔
    ∀ C > (0 : ℝ), ∀ C' > C, ∀ᶠ ε in 𝓝[>] 0,
      ∃ a b n : ℕ,
      0 < n ∧
