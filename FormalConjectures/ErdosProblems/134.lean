For every triangle-free graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with maximum degree $o(\sqrt{n})$
(degree below $n^{1/2 - \varepsilon}$), one can add edges to obtain a triangle-free graph $H$
of diameter $2$ (every two distinct vertices are adjacent or share a common neighbour) while
adding at most $\delta \cdot n^2$ edges, for every $\delta > 0$ and all sufficiently large $n$.
This is Theorem 1.2 of Alon's "Triangle-free graphs of diameter 2".
