Writing $f_{k, 3}(x)$ for the number of integers $\leq x$ which are the sum of three $k$th powers,
is it true that $f_{k, 3}(x) \gg x ^ (3 / k)$?

Writing $f_{k, 3}(x)$ for the number of integers $\leq x$ which are the sum of three $k$th powers,
is it even true that $f_{k, 3}(x) \gg_\epsilon x ^ (3 / k - \epsilon)$?
