Erdős [Er76d] conjectured a stronger statement: if $n_k$ is the $k$th powerful number,
then $n_{k+2} - n_k > n_k^c$ for some constant $c > 0$.

    ∃ (c : ℝ) (h : c > 0), ∀ (k : ℕ),
    Nat.nth Powerful (k + 2) - Nat.nth Powerful k > (Nat.nth Powerful k : ℝ) ^ c := by
  sorry

/--
There is no quadruple of powerful numbers, since at least one of the four numbers must be
$2 \pmod{4}$, which cannot be powerful (since $2$ divides it, but $2^2$ does not).
