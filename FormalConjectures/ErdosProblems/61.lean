For a graph $H$, consider all graphs $G$ that do not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph.
We would like to find a lower bound $f(n)$ such that every such $G$ on $n$ vertices
has a clique or independent set of size $\ge f(n)$ for sufficiently large $n$.

  ∀ᶠ n in atTop, ∀ G : SimpleGraph (Fin n),
    (¬∃ g : α ↪ Fin n, H = G.comap g) → G.indepNum ≥ f n ∨ G.cliqueNum ≥ f n

The Erdős–Hajnal Conjecture states that there is a constant $c(H) > 0$ for each
$H$ such that we can take $f(n) = n^{c(H)}$ in the above formulation.

Erdős and Hajnal [ErHa89] proved that we can take $f(n) = \exp(c_H \sqrt{\log n})$
for some constant $c_H > 0$ dependending on $H$.

Bucić, Nguyen, Scott, and Seymour [BNSS23] improved this to
$f(n) = \exp(c_H \sqrt{\log n \log \log n})$ for some constant $c_H > 0$ dependending on $H$.
