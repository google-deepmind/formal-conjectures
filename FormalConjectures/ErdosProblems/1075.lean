# Erdős Problem 1075

For every $r \geq 3$, there exists $c_r > r^{-r}$ such that for any $\varepsilon > 0$, if $n$ is
sufficiently large, any $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices with at least
$(1+\varepsilon)(n/r)^r$ edges contains a subgraph on $m$ vertices with at least $c_r m^r$ edges,
where $m \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$.

Erdős Problem 1075:

For every $r \geq 3$, there exists $c_r > r^{-r}$ such that for any $\varepsilon > 0$,
for any target size $M$, for all sufficiently large $n$, any $r$-uniform hypergraph
on $n$ vertices with at least $(1+\varepsilon)(n/r)^r$ edges contains a vertex subset $S$
with $|S| \geq M$ and at least $c_r \cdot |S|^r$ edges within $S$.

The condition "$m \to \infty$ as $n \to \infty$" is captured by the universal quantifier over $M$:
for every $M$, eventually (for large $n$) we can find a subgraph on $\geq M$ vertices.
