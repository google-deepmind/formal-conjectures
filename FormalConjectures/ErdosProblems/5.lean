There exists a strictly increasing sequence of indices (n_i)
such that the limit of $(p_{n_i+1} - p_{n_i}) / log p_{n_i}$ equals $\infty$,
where $p_k$ denotes the k-th prime number.

**Note:**
This definition is equivalent to $(p_{n_i+1} - p_{n_i}) / log n_i$
Since $p_n \sim n \log n$, then $\log n \sim \log p_n$

For every nonnegative real number x, there exists a strictly increasing sequence of indices (n_i)
such that the limit of $(p_{n_i+1} - p_{n_i}) / log n_i$ equals $x$,
where $p_k$ denotes the k-th prime number.

At least 1/3 of positive real numbers are in the set of `limit_points` ($S$).
More precisely, the Lebesque measure of $S ‚à© [0, c]$ is at least $c/3$.

There exists some constant $c$ such that $[0,c] \subset S$, where $S$ is `limit_points`.
