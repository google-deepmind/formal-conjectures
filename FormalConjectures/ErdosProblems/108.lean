# Problem 108: Erdős-Hajnal conjecture on subgraphs with high girth and chromatic number

*Reference:* [Erdős Problems](https://erdosproblems.com/108)

For every r≥4 and k≥2, does there exist finite f(k,r) such that every graph of chromatic number ≥f(k,r) contains a subgraph of girth ≥r and chromatic number ≥k?
