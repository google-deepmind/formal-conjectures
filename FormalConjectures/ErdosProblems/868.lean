/-- Let $A$ be an additive basis of order $2$, let $f(n)$ denote the number of ways in which
$n$ can be written as the sum of two elements from $A$. If $f(n)\to\infty$ as $n\to\infty$, then
must $A$ contain a minimal additive basis of order $2$? -/

/-- Let $A$ be an additive basis of order $2$, let $f(n)$ denote the number of ways in which
$n$ can be written as the sum of two elements from $A$. If $f(n)>\epsilon\log n$ for large $n$
and an arbitrary fixed $\epsilon > 0$, then must $A$ contain a minimal additive
basis of order $2$? -/
