Primitive weird numbers are weird numbers such that no proper divisor of $n$ are weird.

The abundancy index is the sum of the divisors of $n$ divided by $n$.

def AbundancyIndex (n : ℕ) : ℚ := (∑ d ∈ n.divisors, d) / n

Are there any odd weird numbers?

Benkoski and Erdős [BeEr74](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/relay-station?mr=347726) proved
that the set of weird numbers has positive density.

The smallest weird number is 70.

Melfi [Me15](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/relay-station?mr=3276337) has proved that there
are infinitely many primitive weird numbers, conditional on the fact that
$p_{n+1} - p_n < \frac{1}{10} p_n^{1/2}$ for all large $n$, which in turn would follow from
well-known conjectures concerning prime gaps.

Fang [Fa22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12906) has shown there are no odd weird numbers below $10^21$.

Liddy and Riedl [LiRi18](https://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/honors_research_projects/728/) have shown
that an odd weird number must have at least 6 prime divisors.

/--
If there are no odd weird numbers then every weird number has abundancy index < 4.
