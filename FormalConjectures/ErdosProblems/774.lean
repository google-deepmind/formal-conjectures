# Erdős Problem 774

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/774](https://www.erdosproblems.com/774)

We call `A ⊂ ℕ` **dissociated** if
∑ n ∈ X n ≠ ∑ m ∈ Y m
for all finite `X, Y ⊂ A` with `X ≠ Y`.

Let `A ⊂ ℕ` be an infinite set.
We call `A` **proportionately dissociated** if every finite `B ⊂ A` contains
a dissociated set of size ≫ |B|.

**Conjecture (open):**
Is every proportionately dissociated set the union of finitely many dissociated sets?
