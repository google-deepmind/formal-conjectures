Prove that there exists an absolute constant $c>0$ such that, whenever $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ is
$k$-coloured (and $N$ is large enough depending on $k$) then there are at least $cN$ many
integers in $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ which are representable as a monochromatic sum (that is, $a+b$
where $a,b\in \{1,\ldots,N\}$ are in the same colour class and $a\neq b$).

A conjecture of Roth. Solved by Erdős, Sárközy, and Sós [ESS89], who in fact prove that
there are at least $\frac{N}{2}-O(N^{1-1/2^{k+1}})$ many even numbers which are of this form.

The $k$-colouring of $\{1,\ldots,N\}$ is formalised as a function `f : ℕ → Fin k`; only its
values on `Finset.Icc 1 N` are inspected, and the monochromatic sums counted are those landing
back in `Finset.Icc 1 N`.

-- Divergences from the hosted theorems (plby and jayyhk state the identical
-- `monochromatic_sums_linear` / `erdos_484` over an auxiliary `monochromaticSumSet`):
-- * hosted bound is `(monochromaticSumSet N k f).card ≥ ⌊c * (N : ℝ)⌋₊`; here the bound is
--   stated directly over ℝ as `c * N ≤ card`, matching the problem's "at least $cN$".
--   The two forms are equivalent up to rescaling the existentially quantified `c`.
-- * hosted proofs define `monochromaticSumSet` as a classical `Finset.filter`; here the same
--   filter predicate is inlined verbatim (same `Finset.Icc 1 N` window, same
--   `a ≠ b ∧ f a = f b ∧ a + b = n` condition), so no auxiliary definition is needed.
-- * `0 < k` here vs `k ≥ 1` hosted (definitionally equal on ℕ).
