/-- An $N$-perfect ruler is a finite subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ (the marks), such that each
positive integer $k \leq N$ can be measured, that is, expressed as a difference $k = a_1 - a_0$
with $a_0, a_1 \in A$. The set $A$ is then also called a difference basis w.r.t. $N$. -/

def PerfectRuler (N : ℕ) (A : Finset ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ k ∈ Finset.range (N + 1), ∃ᵉ (a₀ ∈ A) (a₁ ∈ A), k = a₁ - a₀

/-- We define the set of all $N$-perfect rulers $A$ of length $N$, i.e.
subsets $A \subseteq \{0, \dots, N\}$, s.t. $A$ is $N$-perfect.
This is also called a restricted difference basis w.r.t. $N$. -/

/-- Sanity Check: the trivial ruler is actually a perfect ruler if $K \geq N$ -/

/-- The problem is to determine the limit of the sequence $\frac{F(N)}{\sqrt{N}}$ as $N \to \infty$. -/

/-- A known lower bound to the limit by Leech [Le56], which is $1.56\dots$. -/
noncomputable abbrev lower_bound := √(sSup {2 * (1 - Real.sin θ / θ) | θ ≠ 0})
/-- A known upper bound obtained by constructing Wichmann's Rulers [Wi63]. -/
noncomputable abbrev upper_bound := √3

/-- The existence of the limit has been proved by Erdős and Gál [ErGa48].
The lower bound has been proven by Leech [Le56], who refined an argument of Rédei and Rényi.
The upper bound is due to Wichmann [Wi63]. -/
