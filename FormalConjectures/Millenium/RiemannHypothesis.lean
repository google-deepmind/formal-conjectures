# Riemann Hypothesis

The Riemann Hypothesis asserts that all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function
$\zeta(s)$ have real part $\frac{1}{2}$. The trivial zeros are the negative even integers
$-2, -4, -6, \ldots$. The hypothesis is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems
posed by the Clay Mathematics Institute.

/-- The **Riemann Hypothesis**: all non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have real
part $\frac{1}{2}$. That is, if $\zeta(s) = 0$, $s \neq 1$, and $s$ is not a trivial zero
$-2(n+1)$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $\operatorname{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}$.

This uses the `RiemannHypothesis` type from Mathlib, which is defined as
`∀ (s : ℂ), riemannZeta s = 0 → (¬∃ n : ℕ, s = -2 * (n + 1)) → s ≠ 1 → s.re = 1 / 2`. -/
