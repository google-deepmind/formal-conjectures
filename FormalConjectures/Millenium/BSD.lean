/-- The **weak Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture** for a number field $K$: for every elliptic
curve $E$ over $K$, a meromorphic continuation of its $L$-series has order
$\operatorname{rank}_{\mathbb{Z}} E(K)$ at $s = 1$. [Gross2011], Conjecture 2.10 states the
conjecture assuming only a meromorphic continuation near $s = 1$, while
`HasseWeil.HasMeromorphicContinuation` asks for one on all of $\mathbb{C}$.

The rank is `AddCommGroup.freeRank`, which requires $E(K)$ to be finitely generated. That is the
Mordell--Weil theorem, which Mathlib does not have and which this repository states as a `sorry`
in `EllipticCurveRank.mordell_weil`, so it appears here as a hypothesis. -/
