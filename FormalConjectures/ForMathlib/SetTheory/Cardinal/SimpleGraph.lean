This proposition asserts the Ramsey property `κ → (κ, c)₂`, where `κ` is the
cardinality of the ordinal `ω ^ β` and `c` is some cardinal.

It states that for any 2-coloring of the edges of a complete graph on `κ`
vertices, there must be a monochromatic red clique of size `κ` or a
monochromatic blue clique of size `c`.
