# Busy Beaver Challenge: Antihydra

*Reference:* [bbchallenge](https://wiki.bbchallenge.org/wiki/Antihydra)
-/

/--
Antihydra is a sequence starting at 8, and iterating the function
$$H(n) = \left\lfloor \frac {3n}2 \right\rfloor.$$
The conjecture states that the cumulative number of odd values in this sequence
is never more than twice the cumulative number of even values

It is a relatively new open problem with, so it might be solvable, although
seems quite hard. It is equivalent to non-termination of a particular 6-state
turing machine.

theorem busy_beaver_antihydra (a : ℕ → ℕ) (b : ℕ → ℤ)
    (a_ini : a 0 = 8) (a_rec : ∀ n, a (n+1) = (3*a n/2 : ℕ)) (b_ini : b 0 = 0)
    (b_rec : ∀ n, b (n+1) = if a n % 2 = 0 then b n + 2 else b n - 1) :
    ∀ n, b n ≥ 0 := by
  sorry
