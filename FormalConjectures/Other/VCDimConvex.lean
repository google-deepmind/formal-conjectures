# VCₙ dimension of convex sets in ℝⁿ, ℝⁿ⁺¹, ℝⁿ⁺²

In the literature it is known that every convex set in ℝ² has VC dimension at most 3,
and there exists a convex set in ℝ³ with infinite VC dimension (even more strongly,
which shatters an infinite set).

This file states that every convex set in ℝⁿ has finite VCₙ dimension, constructs a convex set in
ℝⁿ⁺² with infinite VCₙ dimension (even more strongly, which n-shatters an infinite set),
and conjectures that every convex set in ℝⁿ⁺¹ has finite VCₙ dimension.
