# Ramanujan τ-function

There are two conjectures related to the Ramanujan τ-function:

- Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture: For every prime `p`, the absolute value of the
  Ramanujan τ-function at `p` is bounded by `2 * p^(11/2)`.
- Lehmer's conjecture: The Ramanujan τ-function is never zero for any positive integer `n`.
