# Singmaster's conjecture

*Reference:* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singmaster%27s_conjecture)

Singmaster's conjecture says that for any integer $t>1$, the number of solutions to the equation:

`$\binom{n}{k} = t,\quad 1 \le k < n,$`

with $\binom{n}{k}$ being the numbers that appear in Pascal's triangle, is bounded by a global
constant $O(1)$.
