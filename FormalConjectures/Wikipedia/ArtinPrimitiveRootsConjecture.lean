**Artin's Conjecture on Primitive Roots**, first half.
Let a be an integer that is not a square number and not −1. Then the set `S(a)`
of primes `p` such that `a` is a primitive root modulo `p` has a positive asymptotic
density inside the set of primes. In particular, `S(a)` is infinite.

**Artin's Conjecture on Primitive Roots**, second half.
Write `a = a_0 b^2` where `a_0` is squarefree. Under the conditions that `a` is not a perfect power and `a_0` is not congruent to `1` modulo `4`
(sequence A085397 in the OEIS), the density of the set `S(a)` of primes `p` such that `a` is a primitive root modulo `p`
is independent of `a` and equals Artin's constant,

**Artin's Conjecture on Primitive Roots**, second half, different residue version
If `a` is a square number or `a = −1`, then the density of the set `S(a)` of primes `p` such that `a` is a primitive root modulo `p` is `0`.

**Artin's Conjecture on Primitive Roots**, second half, power version
If `a` is a perfect pth power for prime `p`, then the density of the set `S(a)` of
primes `p` such that `a` is a primitive root modulo `p`
is given by `p(p-2) / (p^2 - p - 1) * C` where `C` is Artin's constant. If there are
more than one such prime `p`, then the number needs to be multiplied by
``p(p-2) / (p^2 - p - 1)` for all such primes `p`.

**Artin's Conjecture on Primitive Roots**, second half, perfect prime power version
Write `a = a_0 b^2` where `a_0` is squarefree.
If `a_0` is congruent to `1 mod 4`, then the density of the set `S(a)` of primes `p` such that `a` is a primitive root modulo `p`
is given by `C * ∏_p, p(p-1) / (p^2 - p - 1)` where `C` is Artin's constant and the product is taken over the prime factors `p` of `a_0`
