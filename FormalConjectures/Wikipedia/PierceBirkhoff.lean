# Pierce–Birkhoff conjecture

*Reference:* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierce%E2%80%93Birkhoff_conjecture)

The Pierce-Birkhoff conjecture asserts that any piecewise-polynomial function can be expressed
as a maximum of finite minima of finite collections of polynomials. It was first stated in 1956
by Garrett Birkhoff and Richard S. Pierce, though the modern rigorous formulation is due to
Melvin Henriksen and John R. Isbell.

The conjecture has been proved for `n = 1` and `n = 2` by Louis Mahé.

A set is semi-algebraic in `ℝⁿ` if it can be described by a finite boolean combination
of multivariate polynomial equations and inequalities.

closed semi-algebraic sets such that the restriction of `f` to each set in the covering is polynomial.

The Pierce-Birkhoff conjecture states that for every real piecewise-polynomial function
`f : ℝⁿ → ℝ`, there exists a finite set of polynomials `gᵢⱼ ∈ ℝ[x₁, ..., xₙ]` such that
`f = supᵢ infⱼ(gᵢⱼ)`.
