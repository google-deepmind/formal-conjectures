**Four exponentials conjecture**
Let $x_0, x_1$ and $y_0, y_1$ be $\mathbb Q$-linearly independent pairs of complex numbers,
then some $e^{x_i y_j}$ is transcendental.

The four exponential conjecture would imply that for any irrational number $t$,
at least one of the numbers $2^t$ and $3^t$ is transcendental.
