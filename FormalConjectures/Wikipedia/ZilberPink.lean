Zilber–Pink Conjecture

Informal statement:
Let X be a mixed Shimura variety or a semiabelian variety over ℂ,
and let V ⊆ X be a subvariety. Then V contains only finitely many
maximal atypical subvarieties.

This conjecture is a central open problem in arithmetic geometry,
generalizing earlier conjectures such as André–Oort and Mordell–Lang.

Formalization status:
This conjecture is currently not formalizable in mathlib due to the
absence of major foundational components, including:
* Shimura varieties (mixed and unmixed)
* Semiabelian varieties
* Special subvarieties
* Atypical subvarieties
* Mixed Hodge structures
