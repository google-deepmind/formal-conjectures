/-! # Gauss Circle Problem

Consider a circle in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with center at the origin and radius $r\geq 0$.
Gauss's circle problem asks how many points there are inside this circle of the form
$(m, n)$ where $m$ and $n$ are both integers. Equivalently, how many pairs of integers
$m$ and $n$ are there such that
$$
  m^2 + n^2 \leq r^2.
$$

Let $N(r)$ be thenumber of points $(m, n)$ within a circle of radius $r$, where $m$ and $n$ are both
integers.

Let $E(r)$ be the error term between the number of integral points inside the circle and the
area of the circle; that is $N(r) = \pi r^2 + E(r)$.

Gauss proved that
$$
  |E(r)|\leq 2\sqrt{2}\pi r.

Hardy and Laundau independently found a lower bound by showing that
$$
  |E(r)| \neq o\left(r^{1/2}(\log r)^{1/4}\right)

It is conjectured that the correct bound is
$$
  |E(r)| = O\left(r^{1/2 + o(1)})\right)

The value of $N(r)$ can be expressed as
$$
  N(r) = 1 + 4\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\left(\left\lfloor\frac{r^2}{4i+1}\right\rfloor -
    \left\lfloor\frac{r^2}{4i + 3}\right\rfloor\right).
