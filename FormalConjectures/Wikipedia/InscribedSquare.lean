# Inscribed square problem

The *inscribed square problem* or *Toeplitz conjecture* asks whether every Jordan curve (i.e. simple
close curve in ‚Ñù¬≤) admits an inscribed square, i.e. a square whose vertices all lie on the curve.
There are several open and solved variants of this conjecture.

/-- Four points `a b c d` in the plane form a rectangle  with `a` opposite to `c` iff the line
segments from `a` to `c` and from `b` to `d` have both the same length and the same midpoint, acting
as the diagonals of the rectangle. We also require the rectangle to be nondegenerate and have a
given aspect ratio `ratio : ‚Ñù`. -/
