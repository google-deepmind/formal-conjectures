# Determinantal conjecture

Determinantal Conjecture asks whether the determinant of a sum $A + B$
of two $n$ by $n$ normal complex matrices A and B lies in the convex hull
of the n! points $\prod i (\lambda(A)_i + \lambda(B)_{σ(i)})$,
where the numbers $\lambda (A)_i$ and $\lambda (B)_i$ are
the eigenvalues of $A$ and $B$, and $\sigma$ is an element of the symmetric
group $S_n$.

Here, we represent the two normal matrices as $U_1 D_1 U_1^*$ and
$U_2 D_2 U_2^*$ respectively, where $U_1, U_2$ are unitary and $D_1, D_2$
are diagonal. This is an universal form of a normal matrix,
allowing to retrieve $\lambda (A)_i$ as ${D_1}_{i,i}$, whereas the current mathlib
doesn't support obtaining the vector of eigenvalues from a general normal
non-Hermitian matrix.
