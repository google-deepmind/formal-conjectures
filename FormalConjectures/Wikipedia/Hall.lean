# Hall's conjecture

There exists a positive number $C$ such that for any integer $x, y$ with $y^2 \ne x^3$,
$|y^2 - x^3| > C \sqrt{|x|}$.

Elkies' example $(x, y) = (5853886516781223, 447884928428402042307918)$ shows that such $C$ must be
less than $0.0215$. Note that simple `linarith` does not work here.

Danilov proved that one cannot replace the exponent $1/2$ with larger number.
In other words, for any $\delta > 0$, there is no positive constant $C$ such that
$|y^2 - x^3| > C |x| ^ {1/2 + \delta}$ for all integers $x, y$ with $y^2 \ne x^3$.
