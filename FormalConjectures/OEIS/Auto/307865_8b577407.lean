A307865: $a(n)$ is the number of natural bases $b < 2n+1$ such that $b^n \equiv -1 \pmod{2n+1}$.
The bases $b$ are interpreted as $b \in \{1, 2, \dots, 2n\}$. We check the condition in the ring $\mathbb{Z}/(2n+1)\mathbb{Z}$.

A natural number $m > 1$ is an absolute Euler pseudoprime if it is composite and
for all $b$ coprime to $m$, $b^{(m-1)/2} \equiv \pm 1 \pmod m$.

oeis_307865_conjecture_0: Conjecture: if $2n+1$ is an absolute Euler pseudoprime, then $a(n) = 0$.
Note: this conjecture trivially holds for $n=0$ since $2 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1$, which is not an absolute Euler pseudoprime.
For a meaningful statement, one usually considers $n>3$.
