The auxiliary sequence $x(n)$, where $x(1)=1$ and $x(n) = 2 \cdot x(n-1) + \mathrm{lcm}(x(n-1), n)$ for $n > 1$.
`x_seq n` corresponds to the OEIS term $x(n)$.
This definition is set up for `n : ℕ` where $n=0$ and $n=1$ are base cases for $x(0)$ and $x(1)$.
Note: Mathlib's `lcm` is `Nat.lcm`.

Conjecture: For prime p such that p-2 is not a prime, a(p-1) = p.
p-2 in natural numbers is $\max(0, p-2)$.
A prime $p$ such that $p-2$ is not a prime means $p$ is not the larger element of a twin prime pair, except for $p=3$ where $p-2=1$ (not prime) and $p=2$ where $p-2=0$ (not prime).
