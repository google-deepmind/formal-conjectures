A generalized recursive definition for the coefficients of any exponential series $\exp(\sum d_k \frac{x^k}{k})$.
The coefficients $a_k$ satisfy $k \cdot a_k = \sum_{j=1}^k d_j \cdot a_{k-j}$.
This is a local helper function inside `b_m_int`.

The sequence $b_m(n)$ is defined by $b_m(n) := [x^n] A_m(x)^n$ for $n \ge 1$.
We define $b_m(n)$ as the $n$-th coefficient of the series $\exp(L_{m,n}(x))$, where the driving coefficients are $d_k = n \cdot c_m(k)$.
Since this sequence is in $\mathbb{N}$, we define it in $\mathbb{Z}$ for the congruence.

oeis_333042_conjecture_1:
More generally, for a positive integer $m$, set $A_m(x) = \exp( \sum_{n \ge 1} (m*n)!/(n!^m) * x^n/n )$
and define a sequence $\{b_m(n): n \ge 1\}$ by $b_m(n) := [x^n] A_m(x)^n$.
Then we conjecture that $b_m(n)$ is an integer sequence satisfying the supercongruences
$b_m(n p^r) \equiv b_m(n p^{r-1}) \pmod{p^{3r}}$ for prime $p \ge 5$ and all positive integers $m, n, r$.
