A333096: The $n$-th order Taylor polynomial (centered at 0) of $c(x)^{4n}$ evaluated at $x=1$, where $c(x) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 - 4x}}{2x}$ is the o.g.f. of the sequence of Catalan numbers $A000108$.
The sequence is defined by the formula:
$$a(n) = \sum_{k = 0}^n \frac{4n}{4n+k}\binom{4n+2k-1}{k} \quad \text{for } n \ge 1$$
and $a(0) = 1.$$
The summand is the $k$-th coefficient of the power series $c(x)^{4n}$, which is an integer.

We conjecture that the sequence satisfies the stronger supercongruences
$a(n \cdot p^k) \equiv a(n \cdot p^{k-1}) \pmod{p^{\left(3k\right)}}$ for prime $p \ge 5$ and positive integers $n$ and $k$.
