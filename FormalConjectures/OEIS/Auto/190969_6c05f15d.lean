Conjecture of Zhi-Wei Sun on the sum $S(p)$ for the sequence A190969.
Let $S(p) := \sum_{k=0}^{p-1} \frac{a(4k) \binom{2k}{k}^3}{(-4096)^k}$.
Sun conjectured that $S(p) \equiv 0 \pmod{p^2}$ for every odd prime $p$,
and also $S(p) \equiv 0 \pmod{p^3}$ for any odd prime $p \equiv 1,2,4 \pmod{7}$.

The sum is formalized here by interpreting the division as multiplication by the modular inverse
in the ring $\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}$. Since $p$ is an odd prime, $4096$ is invertible modulo $p^n$.
