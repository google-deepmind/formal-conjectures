A381587 $T_n$: The $n$-th row of the irregular triangle, following the recurrence:
$T_1=[1], T_2=[1], T_3=[2]$. For $n \ge 4$, $T_n = \text{Runs}(\text{Reverse}(T_{n-1})) \frown T_{n-1}$.
$n$ is 1-indexed here.

A381358: Row sums of irregular triangle A381587.
Row $n$ elements are $T_n$. The sequence $a(n)$ is the list sum of $T_n$.

A381358 If it exists, the limit of $\mathrm{A381358}(n)^{1/n}$ as $n \to \infty$.
The conjecture is that this limit exists.
