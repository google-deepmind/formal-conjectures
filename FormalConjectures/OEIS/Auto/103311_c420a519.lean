A103311: A transform of the Fibonacci numbers.
The sequence $a(n)$ satisfies the linear recurrence relation:
$$a(n) = 3a(n-1) - 4a(n-2) + 2a(n-3) - a(n-4)$$
with initial terms $a(0)=0, a(1)=1, a(2)=1, a(3)=0$.
The sequence takes values in $\mathbb{Z}$.

Conjecture: all elements in absolute value are Fibonacci numbers. That is, for every $n$, $|a(n)| = \operatorname{fib}(m)$ for some $m \in \mathbb{N}$.
