Helper definition for A078590, indexed from 0.
a_val 0 corresponds to A078590(1).
a_val 1 corresponds to A078590(2).
a_val (n+2) corresponds to A078590(n+3).
The definition uses standard natural number division, relying on the conjecture that the division is exact.

  let a_n_minus_2 : ℕ := a_val n
  let a_n_minus_1 : ℕ := a_val (n + 1)

  -- The division is Nat.div, which is integer division.
  -- The terms are positive, so we do not fear division by zero.
  (2 ^ a_n_minus_1 + 1) / a_n_minus_2

oeis_78590_conjecture_0: Are all terms integers?
This is framed as a divisibility conjecture, ensuring that the division in the definition is exact at every step.
Specifically, for $n \ge 3$, $a(n-2)$ divides $2^{a(n-1)} + 1$.
