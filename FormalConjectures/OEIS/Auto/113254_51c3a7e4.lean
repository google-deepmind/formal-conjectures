A113254: Corresponds to $m = 8$ in a family of 4th-order linear recurrence sequences.

The sequence $a(n)$ is defined by the initial conditions $a(0)=-1, a(1)=4, a(2)=176, a(3)=3136$,
and the linear recurrence relation $a(n) = -4 * a (n-1) + 256 * a (n-3) + 4096 * a (n-4)$ for $n \ge 4$.

/-- oeis_113254_conjecture_0: Conjecture: a(m, 2*n+1) is a perfect square for all m,n (see A113249).
For the specific sequence A113254 (which fixes m=8), this conjecture is interpreted as:
a(2*n+1) is a perfect square for all n.
