A383327: $a(n)$ is the number of occurrences of $n$ in A049802.
A049802(m) is the sum of $(m \bmod 2^k)$ for $k=1, \dots, \lfloor \log_2 m \rfloor$.

Conjecture based on OEIS A383327 comment:
From a combinatorial perspective, the tuple of summands (x_1, ..., x_t) mentioned above can be seen as a set of t counters, where the j-th counter cycles through 0 to 2^j-1. The natural question 'which m in A049802 appear k times?' becomes a question about how this cycling condition restricts the number of tuples which sum to m. For example, for n <= 100, when n = 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 23, 35, 63, 65, and 67 there is only one m such that the tuple of summands sums to n (a trivial tuple consisting of n 1s, trivial because there is such a tuple for every n >= 1, i.e. for every m = 2^n+1).
This is a precise statement about the set of values $n$ for which $a(n) = 1$ among $n \le 100$.
