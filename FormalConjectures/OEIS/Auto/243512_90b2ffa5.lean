A243473(i) is the difference between the numerator $p$ and the denominator $q$
when the per-unit sum-of-divisors $\sigma_1(i)/i$ is written in its lowest terms $p/q$.
$$ \mathrm{A243473}(i) = \mathrm{num} \left( \frac{\sigma_1(i)}{i} \right) - \mathrm{den} \left( \frac{\sigma_1(i)}{i} \right) $$

A243512: Least index $i$ for which $\mathrm{A243473}(i)=n$, or $0$ if no such index exists.

Motivated by the observation that some small numbers (2,12,14,18,...) occur only very late
in the recently added sequence A243473, but all numbers seem to appear sooner or later.
(The definition is completed by "0 if no such index exists" to guarantee well-definedness
in absence of a proof, but I conjecture that no such 0 will ever occur.)
The conjecture is that the sequence $\mathrm{A243473\_val}$ is eventually surjective onto $\mathbb{N} \setminus \{0, 1\}$.
