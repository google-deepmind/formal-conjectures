A295124: $a(n)$ is the smallest number $k$ with $n$ prime factors such that $2d + k/d$ is prime for every $d \mid k$.
The definition interprets "n prime factors" as $n$ distinct prime factors ($\omega(k) = n$).

This is formalized as the set $S(n)$ of candidate numbers being non-empty for all $n$. -/
