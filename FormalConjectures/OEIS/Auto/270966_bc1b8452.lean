A270966: Number of ways to write $n$ as $x^2 + y^2 + z(3z+1)/2$, where $x, y$ and $z$ are integers with $0 \le x \le y$ such that $x$ or $y$ has the form $p-1$ with $p$ prime.
The number of ways is the count of valid pairs $(x, y)$ because for each such pair, $k = n - x^2 - y^2$ is a generalized pentagonal number, which corresponds uniquely to an integer $z$.
