Granville's ABC-Conjecture implies that for any $\epsilon > 0$,
the function $a(n)$ is bounded below by $(\log n)^{1 - \epsilon}$ for sufficiently large $n$.
This is a formalization of a claim implied by the context:
OEIS C: "This function of n appears in an ABC-conjecture by Andrew Granville. See Goldfeld."
Granville (via Goldfeld) showed that ABC conjecture $\iff$ $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N, \forall n > N, a(n) \ge (\log n)^{1-\epsilon}$.
