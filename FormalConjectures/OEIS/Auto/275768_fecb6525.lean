A275768: $a(n)$ is the number of ways to express $n = \frac{\operatorname{prime}(i) + \operatorname{prime}(j)}{2}$ when $\frac{|\operatorname{prime}(i) - \operatorname{prime}(j)|}{2}$ also is prime.
This is equivalent to counting the number of primes $q$ such that $n - q$ and $n + q$ are also prime.
