A048153: $a(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n (k^2 \bmod n)$.
This sequence is defined in Lean as the sum of $k^2 \bmod n$ for $k \in \{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$.

Conjecture: a(n) <= (n^2-1)/2. - _Aspen A.M. Meissner_, Mar 06 2025
We require $n \ge 1$ for the difference $n^2 - 1$ to be a natural number.
The division `/ 2` is natural number (integer) division.
