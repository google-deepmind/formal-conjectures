A237271: Number of parts in the symmetric representation of $\sigma(n)$.
a(n) is $1$ plus the number of pairs $(d_k, d_{k+1})$ of consecutive divisors of $n$
such that $d_{k+1}$ is odd and $d_{k+1} \ge 2 d_k$.

The formula used is $1 + |\{(d_k, d_{k+1}) \in \text{consecutive pairs of divisors of } n \mid d_{k+1} \text{ is odd and } d_{k+1} \ge 2 d_k\}|$, which is a known characterization of the sequence.

Number of maximal contiguous sublists of divisors of n where each adjacent pair (d_k, d_{k+1})
satisfies d_{k+1} <= 2 * d_k.
This is 1 + the number of "jumps" where d_{k+1} > 2 * d_k.

A237271 Conjecture 2: a(n) is the number of 2-dense sublists of divisors of n.
We call "2-dense sublists of divisors of n" to the maximal sublists of divisors of n
whose terms increase by a factor of at most 2.
The conjecture 2 is essentially the same as the second conjecture in the Comments of A384149.
