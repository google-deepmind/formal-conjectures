# Equidistributed Sequences

Corollary 4.2 of Chapter 1 states that the sequence $(x^n), n = 1, 2, ... ,$ is equidistributed modulo 1 for
almost all x > 1. And a little bit further down:
"one does not know whether sequences such as $(e^n)$, $(π^n)$, or even $((\frac 3 2)^n)$"
are equidistributed modulo 1 or not.

A sequence `(s_1, s_2, s_3, ...)` of real numbers is said to be equidistributed on
an interval `[a, b]` if for every subinterval `[c, d]` of `[a, b]` we have
`lim_{n→ ∞} |{s_1, ..., s_n} ∩ [c, d]| / n = (d - c)/(b-a)`

A sequence `(s_1, s_2, s_3, ...)` of real numbers is said to be equidistributed
modulo 1 or uniformly distributed modulo 1 if the sequence of the fractional parts of
`a_n`, denoted by `(a_n)` or by `a_n − ⌊a_n⌋`, is equidistributed in the interval `[0, 1]`.

A point `x` is an accumulation point of a sequence `s_0, s_1, ...`
if any neighbourhood of `x` contains a point of the sequence distinct
from `x`.
