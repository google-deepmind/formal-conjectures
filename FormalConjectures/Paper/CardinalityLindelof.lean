# Conjecture about cardinality of Lindelöf spaces

The conjecture asks for a Lindelöf space where all singletons are G_δ sets
and which has cardinality > 𝔠.

This is Problem 1 in https://www.math.md/files/basm/y2013-n2-3/y2013-n2-3-(pp37-46).pdf.pdf

/--
Is there a Lindelöf space with singletons as Gδ sets with cardinality greater than the continuum?

  sorry

-- TODO: under additional axioms (consistent with ZFC), such a space exists.
