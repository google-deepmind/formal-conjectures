inductive IsFusible : ℚ → Prop

  | fuse (a b : ℚ) : IsFusible a → IsFusible b → |a - b| < 1 → IsFusible ((a + b + 1) / 2)

/-- If `x` is a fusible number and `y` is its successor, then the interval `[x + 1, y + 1)` can be
divided into intervals `[ℓₙ, ℓₙ₊₁)`, such that the fusible numbers in `[ℓₙ, ℓₙ₊₁)` are obtained by
fusing the `n + 1`st successor of `x` with a fusible number.
This formalization differs from Conjecture 7.1 in the paper in four ways:
(1) it is obtained from Conjecture 7.1 by plugging in `n + 1` into `n`, which simplifies the expressions
  and removes the need to assume `n ≥ 1`;
(2) the `n + 1`st successor `s^(n+1)(x)` is replaced by the explicit value `x + (2 - 1 / 2 ^ n) * m`;
(3) instead of defining `y` to be the successor of `x`, we assert that there is no fusible number between `x` and `y`;
(4) instead of using `∃ z, IsFusible z ∧ q = s^(n+1)(x) ~ z` we use the value of `z` determined by the equality,
  namely `z = 2 * q - 1 - s^(n+1)(x)`, and it is easy to see `z ∈ [x + 1 - m / 2 ^ n, x + 1)` as required. -/
