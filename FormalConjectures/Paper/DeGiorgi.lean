# De Giorgi's conjecture

This file states a conjecture of De Giorgi about entire solutions to $Δ u + u - u^3 = 0$.
The conjecture is a rigidity theorem: in spatial dimension $n ≤ 8$, the level sets of bounded solutions
which satisfy $∂₁u > 0$ everywhere are hyperplanes. It has been shown that the condition $n ≤ 8$ is sharp.

The main theorems are:
- `DeGiorgi_le_eight`: the conjecture holds in dimension $n ≤ 8$.
- `DeGiorgi_ge_nine`: the conclusion of the conjecture does not hold if $n ≥ 9$.

The cases $1 ≤ n ≤ 8$ are also listed individually to enable partial solutions.
The cases $1 ≤ n ≤ 3$ are solved, while $4 ≤ n ≤ 8$ remains open.

## Existing results
- The case $n = 1$ is elementary.
- The case $n = 2$ was proven by Ghoussoub and Gui.
- The case $n = 3$ was proven by Ambrosio and Cabré.
- The case $4 ≤ n ≤ 8$ was proven under an extra assumption by Savin.
- The counterexample for $n ≥ 9$ was proven by Del Pino, Kowalczyk, and Wei.
