A sequence of naturals is complete if any positive natural can be written
as a finite sum of distinct values in the sequence.

/--
For what values of $0 \leq m < n$ is there a complete sequence
$A = \{a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \cdots\}$ of integers such that
 1. $A$ remains complete after removing any $m$ elements, but
 2. $A$ is not complete after removing any $n$ elements.
