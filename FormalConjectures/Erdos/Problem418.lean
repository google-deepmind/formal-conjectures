Are there infinitely many integers not of the form $n - \phi(n)$?

It follows from the Goldbach conjecture that every odd number can be
written as $n - \phi(n)$.

Erdős has shown that a positive density set of integers cannot be written as
$\sigma(n) - n$.

A solution to erdos_418 was shown by Browkin and Schinzel [BrSc95] by
showing that any integer of the form $2^(k + 1)\cdot 509203$ is not of the
form $n - \phi(n)$.

It seems to be open whether there is a positive density set of integers
not of the form $n - \phi(n)$.
