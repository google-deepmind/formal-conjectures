Let $(S_n)_{n \geq 1}$ be a sequence of sets of complex numbers, none of which have a finite
limit point. Does there exist an entire transcendental function $f(z)$ such that, for all $n \geq 1$, there
exists some $k_n \geq 0$ such that
$$
  f^{(k_n)}(z) = 0\quad\text{for all $z\in S_n$?}

Solved in the affirmative by Barth and Schneider [BaSc72], who proved the following.

Let $\{S_k\}$ be any sequence of sets in the complex plane, each of which has no finite
limit point. Then there exists a sequence $\{n_k\}$ of positive integers and a
transcendental entire function $f(z)$ such that $f^{(n_k)}(z) = 0$ if $z \in S_k$.

_the derivatives of an entire function_. Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. (1972), 229--232.
