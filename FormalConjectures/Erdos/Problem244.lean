# Erdős Problem 244

*Reference:* [erdosproblems.com/244](https://www.erdosproblems.com/244)
-/
/-- Let $C > 1$. Does the set of integers of the form $p + \lfloor C^k \rfloor$,
for some prime $p$ and $k\geq 0$, have density $>0$? -/

    (h : { p + ⌊C ^ k⌋₊ | (p) (k) (_ : p.Prime) }.HasDensity α) :
    0 < α :=
  sorry

/-- Romanoff [Ro34] proved that the answer is yes if $C$ is an integer.
