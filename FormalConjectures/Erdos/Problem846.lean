**Euler Problem 846**
Let `A ⊂ ℝ²` be an infinite set for which there exists some `ϵ>0` such that in any subset of `A`
of size `n` there are always at least `ϵn` with no three on a line.
Is it true that `A` is the union of a finite number of sets where no three are on a line?

In other words, prove or disprove the following statement: every infinite `ε`-non-trilinear subset of the
plane is weakly non-trilinar.
