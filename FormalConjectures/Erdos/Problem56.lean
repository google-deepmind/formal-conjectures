Say a set of natural numbers is `k`-weakly divisible if any `k+1` elements
of `A` are not relatively prime.

Suppose `A ⊆ {1,…,N}` is such that there are no `k+1` elements of `A`
which are relatively prime. An example is the set of all multiples of
the first `k` primes. Is this the largest such set?
