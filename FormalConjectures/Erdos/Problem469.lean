/-- The proposition that `n` is a sum of distinct proper divisors. -/
def Nat.IsSumDivisors (n : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∃ S ⊆ n.properDivisors, ∑ d ∈ S, d = n

/--
Let $A$ be the set of all $n$ such that $n = d_1 + ⋯ + d_k$ with $d_i$ distinct
proper divisors of $n$, but this is not true for any $m ∣ n$ with $m < n$. Does:
$$
  \sum_{n ∈ A} \frac 1 n
$$
converge?

theorem erdos_469 :
    letI A := {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ n.IsSumDivisors ∧ ∀ m < n, m ∣ n → ¬ m.IsSumDivisors}
    Summable fun n : A ↦ 1 / (n : ℝ) :=
