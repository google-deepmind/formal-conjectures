# Boxdot Conjecture

This file defines the syntax and proof systems for modal logic, along with the
Boxdot translation and the Boxdot Conjecture. We introduce:

  * `Formula`: the inductive type for propositional modal formulas.
  * `t`: the recursive Boxdot translation function.
  * `KProof` and `KTProof`: axiomatizations of the basic K system and K plus T.
  * `NormalModalLogic`: a structure capturing any normal modal logic.
  * `KT`: the specific normal modal logic corresponding to K plus T.
  * `BoxdotConjecture`: states that if a logic agrees with KT on all
    boxdot-translations, then it cannot be strictly larger than KT.

The Boxdot Conjecture was originally formulated by French and Humberstone and
has been studied in several works. In particular, see:

`Formula` is the inductive type of propositional modal formulas:

* `Atom n` is a propositional variable indexed by `n`.
* `Falsum` is the constant ⊥.
* `Imp α β` is implication `(α → β)`.
* `Nec α` is the necessity operator `□α`.

`t φ` is the Boxdot translation of a formula `φ`. Roughly, t is the mapping `φ ↦ t φ`
from the language of monomodal logic into itself that preserves variables and the logical constant `⊥`,
commutes with the standard truth-functional operators, and is such that `t □a` = `□t a & t a`.
This implementation follows the definition in Steinsvold (AJL).

`KTProof Γ φ` denotes that `φ` is provable from the premises `Γ` in the normal modal logic KT
(also called T). KT extends system K by adding the instances of the T-axiom schema `□φ ~> φ` to K’s
usual axioms and rules of inference.

A “normal modal logic” L is any `Set Formula` such that:
  1. If `K ⊢ φ`, then `φ ∈ L`          (L extends K)
  2. If `φ ∈ L` and `(φ ~> ψ) ∈ L`, then `ψ ∈ L`  (Closed under MP)
  3. If `φ ∈ L`, then `□φ ∈ L`          (Closed under Necessitation)

`KT` is the specific normal modal logic whose theorems are exactly those provable
in `KTProof` from the empty context.

This corresponds to `K ⊕ (□φ → φ)` as in both AJL (Steinsvold) and Jeřábek.
