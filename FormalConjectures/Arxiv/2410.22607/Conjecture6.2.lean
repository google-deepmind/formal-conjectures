-- TODO(firsching): Do we want to be able to define structures / local notation / example defs?

Given positive integers $v,k,t$ and $\lambda$ with $v \geq k \geq t$,
a {\em packing design} $\PD_{\lambda}(t,k,v)$ is a pair $(V,\cB)$,
where $V$ is a $v$-set and $\cB$ is a collection of $k$-subsets of $V$
such that each $t$-subset of $V$ appears in at most $\lambda$ elements of $\cB$.
The elements of $V$ are called {\em points} and the elements of $\cB$ are
{\em blocks}.  Packing designs have been extensively studied; the reader is
referred to~\cite[Chapter 9]{BlueBook} and~\cite[Section VI.40]{Handbook}.

The following blocks form a $\PD(4;3,6)$.

If $nk-\alpha_{\lambda}(n) \leq \lambda v < (n+1)k-\alpha_{\lambda}(n+1)$, then $\PDN_{\lambda}(k,v)=n$.
